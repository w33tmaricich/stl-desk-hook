# desk-hook

OpenSCAD source code for a hook for hanging things on my workbench.

## Usage

The compiled stl should be in the current directory. Open with `openscad` if you
want to make modifications yourself.

## Designs

### V2

The most recent iteration. has a bar across the top that spans the width of the
opening. double hook for more hanging goodness.

### V1

The original design. Worked well, but you needed to bend the pla slightly in order
to get the hook in place. Once it was there though, it wasnt going anywhere.
